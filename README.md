# P2P Video Chat Application

The aim of the project is to provide a video chat application.

## UX

As a user, upon arriving the browser will prompt me to access my camera and microphone.

As a user, after I give it permission, I am prompted to type in a room name.

As a user, once I type in a room name, a room will be created if no room of that name existed before.

As a user, I expect a friend of mine can subsequently go to the same website, type in the same room I entered, and join the same room, then enter into a video chat with me.

As a user, if I type in a room name, and there are already two people at the room, I get a notification that the room is full.

As a user, I expect anyone to create or join any room.  And there can be any number of rooms, but all of them must have unique names.

As a user, I can choose not to permit the site to access my microphone and webcam.  If I choose not to do this, or if some other driver problem occurs, I see an error message saying these are required.

As a user, when I choose to cancel the room name input step, or if I type in no name, or just spaces, it should ask me again to type in a valid room name.

As a user, I expect that if one of the two people in the room get disconnected, they can reconnect to the same room and continue chatting.
